# Java-Spring-Microservices-Application
Tech Stack: Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, Zipkin, API Gateway, RabbitMQ

Designed and developed a monolithic application with three key services: Job, Company, and Review.
Transformed the monolithic structure into a robust microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability.
Implemented a centralized service registry to facilitate seamless communication between microservices.
Integrated Docker to containerize each microservice and orchestrated the deployment with Kubernetes, enhancing portability and scalability.
Incorporated an API Gateway to manage and route requests, improve security, and provide load balancing for a streamlined user experience.
Leveraged RabbitMQ to enable event-driven communication, allowing asynchronous messaging between services for efficient and reliable data flow.
Configured Zipkin for distributed tracing, enabling detailed performance monitoring across services for faster debugging and optimization.
This project demonstrates proficiency in modernizing applications from monolithic to microservices, using containerization, orchestration, and messaging for a flexible, scalable, and efficient system design.
